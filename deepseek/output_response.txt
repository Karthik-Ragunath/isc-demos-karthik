A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user
with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and
<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think>
<answer> answer here </answer>. User: What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\left(
     rac{3}{5}x-
ight)^8$? Express your answer as a common fraction.. Assistant: To find the coefficient of \(x^2y^6\) in the expansion of \(\left(\frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2}\right)^8\), I'll use the Binomial Theorem. According to the theorem, each term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{8}{k} \left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^k \left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^{8 - k}
\]

I need the term where the power of \(x\) is 2 and the power of \(y\) is 6. This happens when \(k = 2\). Plugging in \(k = 2\):

\[
\binom{8}{2} \left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^2 \left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^6
\]

First, calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{2}\):

\[
\binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} = 28
\]

Next, compute \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}\) and \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\). Multiplying these together:

\[
\frac{9}{25} \cdot \frac{1}{64} = \frac{9}{1600}
\]

Now, multiply this by the binomial coefficient and account for any signs:

\[
28 \cdot \frac{9}{1600} = \frac{252}{1600}
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
\]

So, the coefficient is \(\frac{63}{400}\).

To find the coefficient of \(x^2y^6\) in the expansion of \(\left(\frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2}\right)^8\), we can use the **Binomial Theorem**, which states:

\[
\left(a + b\right)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}
\]

In our case, \(a = \frac{3}{5}x\), \(b = -\frac{y}{2}\), and \(n = 8\). We need the term where the power of \(x\) is 2 and the power of \(y\) is 6. This happens when \(k = 2\) because:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^{6}
\]

Let's calculate each part step by step:

1. **Binomial Coefficient**:
   \[
   \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} = 28
   \]

2. **Compute \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2\)**:
   \[
   \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}
   \]

3. **Compute \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^6\)**:
   \[
   \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \quad (\text{since the exponent is even})
   \]

4. **Multiply these together with the binomial coefficient**:
   \[
   28 \cdot \frac{9}{25} \cdot \frac{1}{64} = 28 \cdot \frac{9}{1600} = \frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
   \]

So, the coefficient of \(x^2y^6\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{63}{400}}
\]

A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user
with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and
<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think>
<answer> answer here </answer>. User: What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\left(
          rac{3}{5}x-
ight)^8$? Express your answer as a common fraction.. Assistant: To find the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) in the expansion of \( \left( \frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2} \right)^8 \), I'll use the Binomial Theorem. 

The general term in the expansion is given by:
\[
\binom{8}{k} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^k \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{8 - k}
\]

I need the term where the power of \( x \) is 2 and the power of \( y \) is 6. This means:
\[
k = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad 8 - k = 6
\]

Substituting these values into the general term:
\[
\binom{8}{2} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^2 \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^6
\]

Calculating each part:
\[
\binom{8}{2} = 28, \quad \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}, \quad \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Multiplying these together along with \( x^2y^6 \):
\[
28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} \times x^2y^6 = \frac{63}{400}x^2y^6
\]

So, the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) is \( \frac{63}{400} \).
</think>

To find the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) in the expansion of \( \left( \frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2} \right)^8 \), we use the **Binomial Theorem**, which states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^{k}
\]

Here, \( a = \frac{3}{5}x \), \( b = -\frac{y}{2} \), and \( n = 8 \). We need to find the term where the power of \( x \) is 2 and the power of \( y \) is 6. This corresponds to \( k = 2 \) in the binomial expansion, since:

\[
b^{8 - k} = \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{8 - 2} = \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^6
\]

The general term in the expansion is:

\[
\binom{8}{k} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^k \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{8 - k}
\]

Substituting \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{8}{2} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^2 \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^6
\]

Calculating each part:

1. **Binomial Coefficient:**
   \[
   \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{40320}{2 \times 720} = 28
   \]

2. **Power of \( \frac{3}{5}x \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}
   \]

3. **Power of \( -\frac{y}{2} \):**
   \[
   \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \quad \text{(since any number raised to an even power is positive)}
   \]

4. **Combine the Terms:**
   \[
   28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{28 \times 9}{25 \times 64} = \frac{252}{1600}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
   \]

So, the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{63}{400}}
\]
