A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user

<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think>
<answer> answer here </answer>. User: What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\left(
     rac{3}{5}x-
ight)^8$? Express your answer as a common fraction.. Assistant: To find the coefficient of \(x^2y^6\) in the expansion of \(\left(\frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2}\right)^8\), I'll use the Binomial Theorem. According to the theorem, each term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{8}{k} \left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^k \left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^{8 - k}
\]

I need the term where the power of \(x\) is 2 and the power of \(y\) is 6. This happens when \(k = 2\). Plugging in \(k = 2\):

\[
\binom{8}{2} \left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^2 \left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^6
\]

First, calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{2}\):

\[
\binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} = 28
\]

Next, compute \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}\) and \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}\). Multiplying these together:

\[
\frac{9}{25} \cdot \frac{1}{64} = \frac{9}{1600}
\]

Now, multiply this by the binomial coefficient and account for any signs:

\[
28 \cdot \frac{9}{1600} = \frac{252}{1600}
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
\]

So, the coefficient is \(\frac{63}{400}\).
</think>

To find the coefficient of \(x^2y^6\) in the expansion of \(\left(\frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2}\right)^8\), we can use the **Binomial Theorem**, which states:

\[
\left(a + b\right)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}
\]

In our case, \(a = \frac{3}{5}x\), \(b = -\frac{y}{2}\), and \(n = 8\). We need the term where the power of \(x\) is 2 and the power of \(y\) is 6. This happens when \(k = 2\) because:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{5}x\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{y}{2}\right)^{6}
\]

Let's calculate each part step by step:

1. **Binomial Coefficient**:
   \[
   \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} = 28
   \]

2. **Compute \(\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2\)**:
   \[
   \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}
   \]

3. **Compute \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^6\)**:
   \[
   \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \quad (\text{since the exponent is even})
   \]

4. **Multiply these together with the binomial coefficient**:
   \[
   28 \cdot \frac{9}{25} \cdot \frac{1}{64} = 28 \cdot \frac{9}{1600} = \frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
   \]

So, the coefficient of \(x^2y^6\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{63}{400}}
\]

The general term in the expansion is given by:
\[
\binom{8}{k} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^k \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{8 - k}
\]

I need the term where the power of \( x \) is 2 and the power of \( y \) is 6. This means:
\[
k = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad 8 - k = 6
\]

Substituting these values into the general term:
\[
\binom{8}{2} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^2 \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^6
\]

Calculating each part:
\[
\binom{8}{2} = 28, \quad \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}, \quad \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Multiplying these together along with \( x^2y^6 \):
\[
28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} \times x^2y^6 = \frac{63}{400}x^2y^6
\]

So, the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) is \( \frac{63}{400} \).
</think>

To find the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) in the expansion of \( \left( \frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2} \right)^8 \), we use the **Binomial Theorem**, which states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^{k}
\]

Here, \( a = \frac{3}{5}x \), \( b = -\frac{y}{2} \), and \( n = 8 \). We need to find the term where the power of \( x \) is 2 and the power of \( y \) is 6. This corresponds to \( k = 2 \) in the binomial expansion, since:

\[
b^{8 - k} = \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{8 - 2} = \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^6
\]

The general term in the expansion is:

\[
\binom{8}{k} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^k \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{8 - k}
\]

Substituting \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{8}{2} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^2 \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^6
\]

Calculating each part:

1. **Binomial Coefficient:**
   \[
   \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \frac{40320}{2 \times 720} = 28
   \]

2. **Power of \( \frac{3}{5}x \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}
   \]

3. **Power of \( -\frac{y}{2} \):**
   \[
   \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} \quad \text{(since any number raised to an even power is positive)}
   \]

4. **Combine the Terms:**
   \[
   28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{28 \times 9}{25 \times 64} = \frac{252}{1600}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
   \]

So, the coefficient of \( x^2y^6 \) is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{63}{400}}

A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user

<answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think>
<answer> answer here </answer>. User: What is the coefficient of $x^2y^6$ in the expansion of $\left(
                 rac{3}{5}x-
ight)^8$? Express your answer as a common fraction.. Assistant: Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \( x^2 y^6 \) in the expansion of \( \left( \frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2} \right)^8 \). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when expanding a binomial like \( (a + b)^n \), the terms are given by the binomial theorem, which states:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}
\]

In this case, our binomial is \( \left( \frac{3}{5}x - \frac{y}{2} \right)^8 \). So, \( a = \frac{3}{5}x \) and \( b = -\frac{y}{2} \), and \( n = 8 \).

The general term in the expansion is:

\[
\binom{8}{k} \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right)^{8 - k} \left( -\frac{y}{2} \right)^{k}
\]

We need to find the specific term where the powers of \( x \) and \( y \) are 2 and 6, respectively. That means we need:

\[
x^2 \quad \text{and} \quad y^6
\]

Looking at the general term, \( x \) is raised to the power of \( 8 - k \), and \( y \) is raised to the power of \( k \). So, to have \( x^2 y^6 \), we set up the equations:

\[
8 - k = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad k = 6
\]

Solving the first equation gives \( k = 6 \), which matches the second equation. Perfect, that's the term we need.

Now, let's compute this specific term. First, we find the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{8}{6} = \frac{8!}{6! \cdot (8 - 6)!} = \frac{40320}{720 \cdot 2} = \frac{40320}{1440} = 28
\]

Next, let's handle the constants:

\[
\left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{8 - 6} = \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{25}
\]

and

\[
\left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6 = \frac{1}{64}
\]

Because the exponent is even, the result is positive.

Now, multiply all these together:

\[
28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64}
\]

Let's compute this step by step:

\[
28 \times \frac{9}{25} = \frac{28 \times 9}{25} = \frac{252}{25}
\]

Then,

\[
\frac{252}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{252}{1600}
\]

Now, simplify \( \frac{252}{1600} \). Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 4:

\[
\frac{252 \div 4}{1600 \div 4} = \frac{63}{400}
\]

So, the coefficient is \( \frac{63}{400} \).

Wait, let me verify that step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake:

Starting from:

\[
28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{28 \times 9}{25 \times 64}
\]

Calculate numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \( 28 \times 9 = 252 \)

Denominator: \( 25 \times 64 = 1600 \)

So, \( \frac{252}{1600} \) simplifies to \( \frac{63}{400} \) since 252 ÷ 4 = 63 and 1600 ÷ 4 = 400.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to compute this would be:

\[
\binom{8}{6} \times \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{2} \times \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^6
\]

Which is:

\[
28 \times \frac{9}{25} \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{28 \times 9}{25 \times 64} = \frac{252}{1600} = \frac{63}{400}
\]

So, the coefficient is indeed \( \frac{63}{400} \).

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or reasoning.

The coefficient of \( x^2 y^6 \) in the expansion is \( \frac{63}{400} \).
